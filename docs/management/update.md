# Template Update

Thanks to the update mechanism provided natively by `copier`, when a new version of the template is released, you can easily update the project. Just run the following command under the root directory:

```bash
copier update
```

```{note}
The `-A/--skip-answered` flag can be used to skip questions that have already been answered.
```

In most cases, `copier` will manage updates seamlessly. If conflicts arise, they can be resolved manually since everything is version-controlled by Git.

```{tip}
To minimize potential conflicts, there are several suggestions to follow:
1. Avoid modifying the auto-generated files unless absolutely necessary.
1. For template-related changes, consider proposing an issue or change request directly to the template repository.
1. For project-specific changes, adopt an inheritance or extension approach to minimize the changes to auto-generated contents.
```

For more details, please refer to `copier update --help` and [the official documentation](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/updating/).
